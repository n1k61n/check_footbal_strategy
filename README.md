#Functionality

This Python code simulates a gambling scenario with an uncertain outcome. It calculates potential winnings based on an initial investment and the number of "games" played.

**Explanation:**

 `calc_stats` function:**
 This function takes two integer arguments: `bank` representing the initial amount of money, and `times` representing the number of "games" to play. Returns the final amount of money remaining after all "games" are played.



**Overall:**

This code simulates a risky scenario where the outcome of each "game" is uncertain. The win chance is not guaranteed and depends on random factors. It's important to understand that gambling is not a reliable way to make money, and this code is for educational purposes only.
